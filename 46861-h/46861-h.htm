<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Several of the rhymed stories in this book are true stories, and children may
enjoy them the more for knowing that Barney, a real donkey, did run away and
play pranks as the rhymes say; that Midget did ride horseback; that the deer
did toss the hay to the hungry pony; and that Queen Victoria did restore the
birds' nesting-place in the old round tower at Windsor. Pony Rollo, too, is a real
character, clever and lovable, although some liberties have been taken in the
portrayal of him and his doings. Barney Gray is still living, petted by his now
grown-up owners and enjoyed by all children who visit the farm to which the
donkey came about twenty years ago, and a drive with Barney is quite as likely
now as in former days to have unexpected features.</p>

<p>The pictures of Barney and some of the other pets have been drawn by
Mr. Bridgman from photographs taken expressly for this book.</p>

<p>In the belief that such rhymes as are herein offered gratify and increase in
children both the love of animals and the sense of humor, this new volume is sent
forth not only to give pleasure, but to contribute what it may to the fostering of
these desirable traits.</p>

<p>Kindergartners will find here, as in <i>Through the Farmyard Gate</i>, suitable
material for kindergarten use; for example, the cumulative rhyme, <i>The Pigeons</i>,
and the tracing-back rhyme, <i>Who Gives us Our Thanksgiving Dinner?</i></p>

<p>For courteous permission to use such of these rhymes as have already appeared
in print, acknowledgments are made to publishers and periodicals as follows: The
Century Company, New York (<i>St. Nicholas</i>); S. E. Cassino, Salem, Massachusetts
(<i>Little Folks</i>); and Milton Bradley Co., Springfield, Massachusetts (<i>Kindergarten
Review</i>).<br /></p>

<h2>OLD BARNEY'S LATEST PRANK</h2>



<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One sunny winter morning<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The air was crisp and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snow on snow lay drifted deep<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On every road and hill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In cosy stable comfort<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stood Barney, groomed and fed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wistful thoughts of out-of-doors<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were in his long-eared head.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To be a beast of leisure<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is elegant, no doubt,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought Barney, "but it's very dull."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just then he heard a shout,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A battering and banging,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then doors were opened wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And madcap Helen and her chum<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rushed noisily inside.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where's Barney? Where's the harness?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And where's the Barney sleigh?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See, Minna, here's our donkey dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We'll have some fun to-day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The donkey soon was harnessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And loud their laughter rang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As up into the outgrown sleigh<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The jolly comrades sprang.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sleigh-bells jingled gayly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And many a compliment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did Barney get as o'er the snow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At steady pace he went.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How very good and docile,"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Said Minna, "Barney is!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never thought he'd settle down,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
<span class="i2">To be as staid as this!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He does seem tame," said Helen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"It's very strange to think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he's too old for playing jokes."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Here Barney gave a wink.)<br /></span>
</div></div>


<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But what a day for coasting!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And isn't this a climb?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just think how we'll spin down the hill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We'll have the gayest time."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Up, up the hill toiled Barney,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The long, steep, slipp'ry road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sleigh with those substantial girls<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was not an easy load.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last with tugs and straining<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He reached the very top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Barney to his great delight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was here allowed to stop.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here, too, he was unharnessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As if to have a rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What work the girls had planned for him<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old Barney never guessed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He'll follow," said his mistress,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"He loves to follow so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'll chase right on behind the sleigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As coasting down we go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then when we're at the bottom&mdash;"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No more did Barney hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'd let him follow as he liked,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Enough that this was clear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A push&mdash;the sleigh went speeding<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Adown the coasting place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come, Barney! Good old fellow! Come!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Come on! You like to chase."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then nothing loth, old Barney<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Behind the coasters ran.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought he, "For girls and donkey too.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This is a jolly plan."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<div class="figcenter" >

<span class="i0">"They knew I'd like this scamper;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They're kind, I do declare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some children would have coasted down<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And left me tied up there."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full soon they reached the bottom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The girls and Barney too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Barney learned to his dismay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What now he had to do.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For speedily they hitched him<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into the sleigh, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Aha! old Barney," shouted they,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Now drag us up again."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In meekness puzzled Barney<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Submitted to their will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps this time the girls would drive<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Right on beyond the hill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With pulling, tugging, straining,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Once more he reached the top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But scarcely long enough to breathe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was he allowed to stop.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The girls with nimble fingers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unhitched him from the sleigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come, Barney! Follow us again,"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He heard his mistress say.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, following was pleasant,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So, when they made a start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He scampered after, gay and free,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
<span class="i2">With mischief in his heart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet when they reached the bottom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So staid he looked and meek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That naught seemed farther from his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than joke or prank or freak.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, this is fun!" said Helen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I'll always coast this way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hate to trudge back up the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And drag the sled or sleigh."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yes, that's the worst of coasting,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That tedious uphill climb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Barney saves us all that tug,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let's coast a long, long time."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They meant to harness Barney,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And start at once uphill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Barney thought the time had come<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His own plan to fulfil.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, just before his mistress<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The flying rein could seize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Barney gave a sudden leap,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Escaping her with ease.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whoa, Barney!" shouted Helen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When off he clashed, "Whoa, whoa!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both the girls chased after him<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As fast as they could go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Barney sped the faster,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With feet as swift and light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if he had grown young again;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soon he was out of sight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as he scampered homeward,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He thought with gleeful mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of how he'd turned the joke on them,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The girls he'd left behind.<br /></span>

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
